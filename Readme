This project is for SI507 Final Project

In final_project.ipynb, you can see how I import the data and construct them into my data structure.
I am using two non-binary trees in my project.

The operation of my project is simple, just run the project.py file in terminal and you will be greeted
by a question that allow you to choose from four different features.
     1. Determine whether a drug is otc or prescription.
     2. Search for the otc medicine.
     3. Search for information of medines with the same dosage form.
